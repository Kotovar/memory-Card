## How to use

To use memory-Card, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can clone this repository and run the following commands:

`npm install` to install all dependencies

`npm run dev` to start the development server

open `http://localhost:[path]` in your browser

## How it works

To create this application I used the following technologies:

- React + JSX + JavaScript
- SASS
- Vite
- react-parallax-tilt (Library)

---

The game has 3 difficulty levels, the maximum result is saved in the browser. The game takes a long time to load due to receiving images via the API, this was done to improve skills in working with the API.
